## Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing for Big Data Analytics

The IoT is constantly growing. As more devices become available that provide a wide variety of functions, the decision to use the collected data to streamline efficiency comes naturally. IoT devices generate a large amount of data that can be analyzed in real-time or offline to improve productivity. In order to do this, the data needs to be stored and managed in a way that provides convenient access and robust capabilities. This can be accomplished using a combination of edge and cloud computing. In this way, the edge devices provide the real-time analysis and computation while the cloud computing provides storage and resource intensive analytic capabilities. 

Edge devices are devices used for real-time analysis of data as it arrives, which provides immediate results using small amounts of volatile data. Where more robust cloud analysis provides thorough modeling based on large amounts of data, these edge devices can be used to implement solutions with streamlined information while receiving improvements obtained from the cloud analytic results. This seamless integration can be used to perform analysis without waiting for the data to be sent to a centralized location. This way, data can be filtered before it gets to the data stores instead of having to comb through enormous amounts of data at once. This helps reduce processing strain on data mananagement platforms and could potentially decrease long term maintenance costs. It could also help provide real time information for decision making, such as shutting down a machine when a sensor detects a part is failing rather than waiting for the data to be processed after it is stored. Because analysis happens at or near the source, there is lower latency and network connectivity isn't necessary for immediate results, meaning all systems won't fail just because the network is down. All of these factors indicate that a combination of edge and cloud computing would provide a cost effective and productive anlytical environment.
