## IoT Home Automation with Big Data Analysis

The Internet of Things (IoTs) is constantly growing. As more devices become available that provide a wide variety of functions, the decision to use the collected data to streamline efficiency comes naturally. IoT devices generate a large amount of data that can be analyzed in real-time or offline to improve productivity. In order to do this, the data needs to be stored and managed in a way that provides convenient access and robust capabilities. This is accomplished using edge and cloud computing, where the edge devices provide the real-time analysis, and the cloud computing provides storage and resource intensive analysis capabilities. 

Edge devices are devices used for real-time analysis of data as it arrives, which provides immediate results using small amounts of volatile data. With more robust cloud analysis using big data provides the thorough modeling based on large amounts of data, these edge devices can be used to implement solutions with information received from the cloud analysis.
